<h1>About Me</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p id="about-text">
    I'm currently a full-time senior at Univeristy of Wisconsin, graduating in June with a B.S. in Information Science and Technology. I'm also a self-taught artist with a focus in portraits, a budding blogger, a video gamer, and a parent of a cancer-kicking autistic video gaming prodigy. 
    
    <br><br>I currently reside in Marietta, Georgia. My background is in retail and sales management, but my life is in technology and coding. I have two years of experience in Java with additional experience in JavaScript, jQuery, HTML/CSS, LESS, Angular, Command-line Git, PHP, SQL (MySQL and Oracle), MVC layouts, Agile methodology, and Object-Oriented Programming. 
    
    <br><br>I also have seasonal allergies. :(

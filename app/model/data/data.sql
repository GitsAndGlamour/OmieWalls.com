After modeling the user requirements as a logical IS, the design involves taking the logical IS and converting it into a set of designs or specifications that can be implemented by developers to create a working application to meet the requirements to the fullest extent possible. In the analysis and design of IS for large organizations, multiple individuals typically participate in the process: it is common for analysts to work with users, managers, project managers and other analysts to design the system while also working with technical specialists and vendors to implement the required designs.'),
